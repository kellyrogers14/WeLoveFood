    <h3>Casa Mezcal</h3>
    <h4><a href="http://www.casamezcalny.com/">Click for Website</a>
    <h5>86 Orchard Street New York, NY, New York, 10002</h5>
    <p> Located on the bustling cross streets of Orchard and Broome, Casa Mezcal has positioned itself as the go-to Mexican spot for neighborhood locals in the LES.
      The dark atmospere, perfectly lit with candles and dim overhead lamps, lends itself to being the perfect spot for a date night or group birthday party with friends.<br><br>
      <img src="images/tacos.jpg"><br>
      The guacamole is a *must* at this spot, along with the spicy margaritas to start. It's best to get these bad boys in a pitcher if you're in a group. For the entree, you
      really can't go wrong -- from the mole enchiladas to the carne asada tacos, it's a hit no matter what your taste buds are in the mood for. Not only is this spot great for dinner,
      but if you're the brunch going type, they serve a mean chilaquiles. Be sure to ask about their brunch special, too!</p>

            perfect spot to go to for jamming on work, a project, or meeting a friend for a lunch. It's whole vibe is based off of its California roots, welcoming its customers in

            <br>A favorite among the regulars is the quinoa salad -- packed with nutirents, you'd never know how healthy it is by the taste. Pair this with an iced cofee and one of their
            signature pastries (I highly recommend their blueberry muffin!) and you've got youself the real deal. Kick back, relax, and enjoy your afternoon.</p>
