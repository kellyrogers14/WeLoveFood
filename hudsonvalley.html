            Located at the heart of Poughkeepsie, New York, Mill House Brewery is affectionately known to locals as the "perfect night out." Famously known for their exceptional craft beers and overall charm and vibe of their cozy restaurant, it makes for a lovely go-to for city visitors looking for a real, down-to-earth, country-side vibe. Their executive chefs are Culinary Insitute of the Arts alumni whose valor and pride reside in each of their creative dishes served to customers. Two personal favorites are their bread-and-butter subsitute of a basket of aged white cheddar popcorn and their beer cheese and pretzels duo. Their culinary design and brewery creativity truly makes this a high recommendation for anyone looking for the "perfect night out."
