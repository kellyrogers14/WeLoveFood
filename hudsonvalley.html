               Famously known for their exceptional craft beers and overall charm and vibe of their cozy restaurant, it makes for a lovely go-to for city visitors looking for a real, down-to-earth, rustic vibe. Their executive chefs are Culinary Insitute of the American alumni whose valor and pride reflect in each of their creative dishes served to customers.

               Two personal favorites are their bread-and-butter subsitute of a basket of aged white cheddar popcorn and their beer cheese and pretzels duo as an appetizer.

              Their belief is that "food should be as good as the taste in your mind, always." Their take of classic American food is made with local sources from around the community. Definitely try the "St. Louis Style Pork Ribs" made of a half rack applewood smoked heritage pork ribs, shoestring fries, cole slaw, cornbread, and what really makes the dish- their Kilt Spinner BBQ sauce.

              Look for the Sesame Crusted Tuna Ramen Bowl as it is an amazing and creative take on Asian cuisine. It's made with Miso Ramen noodles, kimchi, a soft cooked egg,  and more in a beer infused bone broth.
