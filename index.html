        <ul>
          <li> <h2>Chelsea</h2> </li>
          <li> <p>The precise borders are a matter of controversy, but for the purpose of simplicity we’ll consider them to run from 6th Avenue on the east to the Hudson River on the west; from 14th Street on the south to 30th Street on the north, a total area of two-thirds of a square mile.  Though Chelsea has never been known as an exciting restaurant neighborhood, with the recent appearance of places like Nishi and La Frontera that perception may be changing.  It is nevertheless considered a cradle of the brunch movement, though sidewalk cafes are in relatively short supply, and once it was home to scores of Spanish and Latin-American restaurants, of which few remain. <br>Here are TWO of our favorite Chelsea restaurants, going from south to north. </p>
