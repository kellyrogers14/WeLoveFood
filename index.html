          <li> <h2>Chelsea</h2> </li>
          <li> <p>The precise borders are a matter of controversy, but for the purpose of simplicity we’ll consider them to run from 6th Avenue on the east to the Hudson River on the west; from 14th Street on the south to 30th Street on the north, a total area of two-thirds of a square mile.  Though Chelsea has never been known as an exciting restaurant neighborhood, with the recent appearance of places like Nishi and La Frontera that perception may be changing.  It is nevertheless considered a cradle of the brunch movement, though sidewalk cafes are in relatively short supply, and once it was home to scores of Spanish and Latin-American restaurants, of which few remain. <br>Here are TWO of our favorite Chelsea restaurants.</p>

        <ul>
          <li> <h2>Upper West Side</h2> </li>
          <li> <p>The neighborhood is geographically defined by Central Park, which runs along the east side from 59th Street to 110th Street.  It is bounded on the west by the Hudson River. The neighborhood boasts an area of 1.9 square miles and a population of around 150,000.  Broadway bisects the region with a landscaped median in the middle, furnished with hospitable benches.  This boulevard, along with the stately and ornate apartment houses that line it, is often said to make the Upper West Side resemble Paris, complete with sidewalk cafes, well-stocked grocery stores that display their produce outside, and a bustling, well-dressed crowd.  How many times have you heard someone say, "There are no good restaurants on the Upper West Side"?  Well, the assertion simply isn't true.  <br>Here are TWO of our favorite dining establishments in the neighborhood.</p> </li>

        <ul>
          <li> <h2>Hudson Valley</h2> </li>
          <li> <p>The area is home to a slew of talented chefs, many of whom attended the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and decided to stay close by after graduation.  Excellent cuisine is available throughout the region, and at the Culinary Institute itself.  Rhinebeck, Nyack, and Kingston brim with high-quality restaurants.  Such quality often means high prices, but you can also find appealing inexpensive.  <br>Here are TWO od our favorite dinnig establishments just a few minutes outside of the city.</p> </li>

          <li> <h2>Lower East Side</h2> </li>

          <li> <p>The Lower East Side may be best known to you as the home of rowdy, rollicking nightlife, but that adventure extends to the food scene as well. Restaurants here tend to be as tiny and crowded as bars, but see it as an excuse to meet new people and try new things before you even hit the party scene. You might know iconic spots like Katz's Delicatessen but it's time to venture outside your comfort zone. The immigrant heritage of the LES colors its cuisine, leading to some fascinating hybrids — Chinese-Italian? French-Asian-American fusion? It all makes sense here!  <br>Here are TWO of our favorite restaurants in the LES, enjoy!</p> </li>
