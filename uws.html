            <li> <h2>Boulud Sud</h2> </li>
            <li> <img src="uws_place1.jpg"></li>
            <li><p>Eat this: Duck kataifi, fried artichokes, linguine with razor clams, harira soup, chicken tagine, grapefruit givré, Provençal moelleux

            Drink this: The wine list covers as much Mediterranean ground as the rest of the menu, with reasonable by-the-glass choices from Provence (a crisp Les Agaves rosé, $10) to Lebanon (a melony Château Musar white, $13). There are fine cocktails too, like the sweet and bitter Perfect Date ($14) featuring Maker’s Mark and red and white vermouths.

            Sit here: The best tables in the restaurant are in the middle of the vast open room, where no one gets stuck staring at walls. There’s also an inviting wraparound bar where small plates can be picked at for a light, casual meal.

            Conversation piece: Daniel Boulud began his career in Southern France, working as a young man for legendary chef Roger Vergé at Moulin de Mougins in the hills west of Cannes.</p></li>
            <li><img src="uws_place1a.jpg" width="700px"></li>
            <li><p>New York may be a melting pot, but the populations of Marseille and Nice are also intriguing cultural patchworks. The new French cuisine in those cities features influences imported across porous borders with Spain and Italy and from the former Maghrebi colonies farther south.

            Superchef Daniel Boulud combines the foods of those regions and many more at his most international restaurant, the new Boulud Sud on the Upper West Side. With his executive chef, Aaron Chambers (Café Boulud), he casts a wide Mediterranean net—looking to Israel and Egypt, Turkey and Greece. But the restaurant’s cooking also plays to his strengths; it’s polished and elegant, and still fundamentally French.

            The decor in the dining room betrays Boulud’s loyalty to his homeland: One sunflower-hued wall is hung with Impressionist knockoffs—of Cézanne’s Mont Sainte-Victoire, among other idyllic tableaux. But the framed fakes are not at all what they seem: They’ve been rendered in digital pigments by art star Vik Muniz.</p></li>
            <li><h2>Shun Lee West</h2></li>
            <li><img src="uws_place2.jpg" width="700px"></li>
            <li><p>This Lincoln Center outpost of midtown’s venerable Shun Lee has become a classic in its own right, drawing precurtain regulars since its 1981 opening. The expansive, opulent restaurant is dramatically outfitted in black banquettes, white-clothed tables and illuminated, golden dragons that wrap around the perimeter of the dining room. </p></li>
            <li><img src="uws_place2a.jpg" width="700px"></li>
            <li><p>Chef Michael Tong’s menu offers signature wonders such as Lily in the Woods (Chinese cabbage hearts simmered in broth and served with black wood mushrooms); Beijing duck (a young duckling roasted until crispy and golden and sliced tableside); and Neptune’s Net, a potato nest bursting with scallops, shrimp, lobster and sea bass. Just as much attention is paid to each table’s centerpiece, which is fashioned from vegetables artfully carved into animals and flowers. The experience doesn’t come cheap, but for top-notch regional cuisine and gracious service, it can’t</p></li>
