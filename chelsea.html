          <li> <h2>Chelsea Market</h2> </li>
          <li> <p>Nineteen years ago, this complex of 22 interlocking Nabisco factories covering an entire Chelsea block was transformed into what was supposed to be a food-business incubator and destination for professional and amateur cooks, complete with vegetable markets, bakeries, butcher shops, dairies, kitchenware, and nearly every other resource imaginable. But nearly two decades down the road, it has morphed into a giant food court. No matter, it is one of the city’s most spectacular dining halls, where you can get a whole steamed lobster, Cambodian hero, San Diego-style taco, or farm-to-table meal at a sit-down restaurant, lunch counter, or wine bar.</p> </li>
          <li> <img src="images/Chelsea/LosTacos.jpg" width="700px"> </li>
          <li> <p>This ramshackle stall looks like something that was flown here from a beach in San Diego, and that’s more or less what the spare menu represents. Be sure to stop here and order the <strong>Adobabda Taco</strong>. One look at the twirling cylinder of dripping pork surmounted by a pineapple lets you know just what to order. Here we’d call it al pastor. This is one of the city’s most addictive tacos, and the excellent homemade tortillas keep pace.</p> </li>

          <li> <h2>Stella's Pizza</h2> </li>
          <li> <p>Located a couple blocks north of the Googleplex, Stella’s is one of Chelsea’s oldest and best neighborhood pizza parlors, dating to the 1960s, with the streamlined design to prove it. The regular slice is especially tomatoey and slightly salty, best enjoyed on the two-slices-with-a-can-of-soda $5 lunch special. On the other hand, then you’d miss the dense white broccoli slice, which features cloudy masses of ricotta and mozzarella. Seating is limited to a gleaming metal counter, and you should see the line that winds out the door during mealtimes! Are those Roy Lichtenstein prints on the walls? He once lived nearby.</p> </li>
          <li> <img src="images/Chelsea/Slice.jpg" width="700px"> </li>
          <li> <p>The specialty here is the dough- chewier than the also incredible Village slice but still soft and manages to pack in a crunch at the bottom. While nothing beats the classic plain slice, Stella's also dishes out some of the best garlic knots in the city. Lunch specials featuring two slices and a Coke available.</p> </li>
